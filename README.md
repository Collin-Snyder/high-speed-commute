# HIGH SPEED COMMUTE

High Speed Commute is an action-packed race to work against your boss. Get there first so she doesn't know you're late!

## The Game

Uh oh! You woke up late again (you _knew_ you shouldn't have hit snooze that last time). Fortunately for you, your boss comes in to work later than you - but boy will she be mad if she arrives and you aren't there yet.

You grab a breakfast bar, brush your teeth while throwing on the last clean thing in your closet, and hurry out the door - the race to work begins! Now you've got to navigate your neighborhood's maze of streets to get there first.

### A couple of pointers:

- Watch out for changing stoplights - you can't run a red light in this town.

- Avoid school zones - you have no choice but to proceed through them slowly for safety.

- If you can, grab some coffee on the way! The caffeine boost will turbocharge your driving.

### Front-End
High Speed Commute was built with Javascript and vanilla React (create-react-app) on the front end. For this application I wanted to keep the technology simple to focus on the logic and data structure of the game.

### Back-End 
High Speed Commute uses Node.js and Express to create a server that interacts with a PostgreSQL database and provides all user, game, and level information to the React app.

### Deployment

### Challenges
- In building High Speed Commute, I wanted to learn more about pathfinding algorithms used to move non-player characters, since the Boss character has to both find a working path to a given target and also navigate a maze in the process. Initially I attempted to implement
