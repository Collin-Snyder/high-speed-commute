## Front-End
High Speed Commute was built with Javascript and vanilla React (create-react-app) on the front end. For this application I wanted to keep the technology simple to focus on the logic and data structure of the game.

## Back-End 
High Speed Commute uses Node.js and Express to create a server that interacts with a PostgreSQL database and provides all user, game, and level information to the React app.

## Deployment
[Coming eventually]
